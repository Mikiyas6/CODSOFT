## 🎨 **Styling Inspiration**

- **Font**: `Digital-7 Mono` font to give the display a cool digital look.
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary**: Dark gray for the calculator body.
  - **Secondary**: Golden yellow for operation buttons.
  - **Light Gray**: Subtle background for better focus.
  - **White**: Display text and number buttons for clarity.

---

## ✨ **How It Works**

- **User Input**: Click numbers and operators to build an expression.
- **Live Expression Display**: Input is shown on the screen as you type.
- **Equal Button (`=`)**: Computes the final result.
- **Clear (`AC`)**: Resets the current expression.
- **Toggle Sign (`+/-`)**: Changes the current number’s sign.
- **Percentage (`%`)**: Converts the number into its percentage equivalent.

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Future Improvements**

- **Overflow Handling**: Font size dynamically adjusts to prevent overflow, but there might be edge cases for extremely long results.
- **Expression Error Handling**: Displays `"Error"` if the expression is invalid (e.g., dividing by zero).
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Add support for **scientific operations** (e.g., square roots, exponents).
  - Improve **keyboard support** for a smoother experience.
  - Implement **dark mode** for better usability in low light.
